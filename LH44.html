        </h3>

        Hamilton was born in Stevenage, England, a town about 30 miles (48 km) north of London. He began his racing career when he was eight years old. He won the British Kart Championship when he was 10. Three years later Hamilton was signed to the McLaren and Mercedes-Benz Young Driver Support Programme, where he was given the support and backing he needed to train and develop his skills. From 1998 to 2000 he won European and world karting championships, and at age 15 he became the youngest-ever driver to be ranked number one in the sport.Hamilton progressed to auto racing, and in 2003 he captured the British Formula Renault race series championship by winning 10 of the 15 races he entered. The following year he competed in the Formula Three Euroseries championship. He won the championship in 2005, and in 2006 he joined a team competing in GP2 (Grand Prix 2)—a race series designed to help drivers prepare for F1—and won the GP2 title in his one season in the series.
